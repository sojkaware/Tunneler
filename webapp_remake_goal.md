# Goal For The AI
To code a pixel-perfect remake of the original Tuneller game.

## Technical requirements
The game must be runnable from a statically hosted site, for example from Github pages.

## Pre-requisites
First code isolated demos (each covering a particular aspect or behaviour of the game) so human coder can review them and approve them.
Each demo must be standalone and independently runnable and made with the same technical stack as the final game.
